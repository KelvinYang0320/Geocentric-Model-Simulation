# Geocentric-Model-Simulation
Simulating The Retrograde Motion of Planets in our Solar System
## Heliocentrism
According to the information provided by [NASA](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/overview/), I simulate movement of some of the planets in our solar system.
This model positioned the Sun at the center of the Universe, with Earth and the other planets orbiting aroung it in circular paths and at uniform speeds.
