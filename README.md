# Geocentric-Model-Simulation
Simulating The Retrograde Motion of Planets in our Solar System
## Heliocentrism
According to the information provided by [NASA](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/overview/), I simulate movement of some of the planets in our solar system.
This model positioned the Sun at the center of the Universe, with Earth and the other planets orbiting aroung it in circular paths and at uniform speeds.

## Geocentric Model
Now, I position the Earth at the center of the Universe, and calculate the relative X and Y positions of the planets.

Take Mercury as an example, You can see the Mercury retrograde frequency and how it happens.

We can get the result similar to [representation of geocentrism](https://www.space.fm/astronomy/planetarysystems/geocentricheliocentric.html#gallery-2), often exemplified specifically by the Ptolemaic system.
